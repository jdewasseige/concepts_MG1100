\section{Rigid body dynamics}
\subsection{Velocity of a point on a rigid body}
The velocity $v$ of a point with position vector $x$ 
belonging to the rigid body is given by
\[ v = v_C + \omega \times (x - x_C) \]
where $v_C$ and $\omega$ be respectively the velocity vector
of the center of inertia and the angular velocity vector
and $x_C$ the position vector of the center of inertia.

\subsection{Moment of inertia}
The matrix of inertia is the following
\[ 
  J =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    J_{xx} & J_{xy} & J_{xz} \\    
    J_{yx} & J_{yy} & J_{yz} \\
    J_{zx} & J_{zy} & J_{zz} \\
  \end{bmatrix}
\]

The general formula for finding its components is given by
\begin{equation}
  J_{\Delta} = \iiint d(u,\Delta)^2 \rho \dif V
  \label{eq:component_inertia}
\end{equation}
where $d(x,\Delta)$ is the distance between a point $u$ in the solid 
and the axis $\Delta$.
The inertia matrices are given here below for the solid sphere
and cylinder but no calculations are made.
To understand how to apply equation~\myref{eq:component_inertia}
see Appendix~\ref{app:inertia_sphere}.

The physical unit of the components
are $\si[inter-unit-separator=$\cdot$]{\kilo\gram\meter\squared}$.
It is a symetric and positive semi-definite matrix.
The diagonal components $J_{ii}$ of the matrix are always non-zero
since it would mean an infinite angular acceleration
around the $x$-axis.
The diagonal components $J_{ij}$ indicates us how the object
is going to be accelerated around the $j$-axis when a torque
is applied around the $i$-axis.
This has no sense for symetric objets,
therefore non-diagonal components are zero.
 
\subsubsection*{Cylinder}
We will first derive the components of the inertia matrix
of a cylindrical rigid body with mass $M$,
height $H$, circular cross-section with radius $R$,
with its axis along the $z$-axis.

\[ 
  J = M
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{1}{12} H^2 + \frac{1}{4} R^2 & 0 & 0 \\    
    0 & \frac{1}{12} H^2 + \frac{1}{4} R^2 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & \frac{1}{2} M R^2 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
\]


\subsubsection*{Sphere}
Now with spherical rigid body of mass $M$ and radius $R$.

\[ 
  J = M
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{2}{5} M R^2 & 0 & 0 \\    
    0 & \frac{2}{5} M R^2 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & \frac{2}{5} M R^2 \\
  \end{bmatrix}
\]
